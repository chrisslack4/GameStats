# Overview

In this software I welcome the user. I request the location of the CSV file and then give the user various bit of information about the CSV file. this starts with general inforamtion like headings, and total sales, then it gets a bit more indepth. The software examines the data and creates graphs for the user to butter understand the data and also exports out data extrapolated to other CSV files.

The purpose for writing this software was to give me expereince with other forms of data manipluation. As I worked on deciding on a data set to use the game statistics was attractive to me for the sake it helped me better understand the principles not just for programming but also marketing research.

# Development Environment

For this project I used Visual Studio Code to do the Programing. This required the backend R 4.3.2 software. By using Visual studio it gives a cleaner look to the coding enviroment along with various helps with the code. Libraries were all installed within R though. Another tool that I used was Kaggle. Though there are many ways and places to obtain data in the form of CSV files kaggle had a good veriety.

For this project I programed in R code. This code is heavily used for large data interpritation. The dplyr is a package that provides a set of tools for efficently working with data sets. With simular origins tidyr a handy package that is good for cleaning up data into variable columns and rows and cells.

# Future Work
- I would like to fix the column labels on the bar graphs so it is easies to read the data.
- I would like to add additional insights to the dat by comparing various numbers.
- I would like to add and export of the graphs for easier use.
- I would like to fix the save location of the exported csv files to be the same as the program.
